# AGENTS Instructions

This repository holds a simple Minesweeper web site.
All files should remain in the repository root.
The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only; no frameworks or build steps.

## Coding guidelines
- Use modern ES6 syntax.
- Keep code compact and easy to understand.
- Use two spaces for indentation in HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Include semicolons in JavaScript.

## File layout
- `index.html` – main page.
- `style.css` – page styling.
- `main.js` – game logic and DOM manipulation.

## Manual testing
Open `index.html` directly in a browser. There are no automated tests or build scripts.

## Pull requests
Summaries should mention key features or fixes. No testing commands are required in PRs.
